# ifs
Render an image of a fractal generated with an iterated function system (IFS).

### System Requirements
Any normal C compiler will do.  The script assumes a regular Linux environment with bash.

### Quickstart
From within the ifs directory, run this script to compile and generate IFS fractals in an endless loop: 

1. `chmod +x ./ifs.sh`
2. `./ifs.sh`

### Generating Fractals
This generates fractals based on parameters chosen at random.  You can fiddle with the ranges of random parameters by making changes at the head of ifs.c and recompiling.
